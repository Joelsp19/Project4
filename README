Project is fully functional for the most part

- There are a couple bugs when it comes to 
hierarchical directories such as removing/removing all

- We attempted to implement:
	- filesystems
	- mount verification
	- readdir and renaming files

Other basic stuff:
- We used linked list allocation for free blocks
- We also used linked list alloation to get from file extent to file extent
- Directory inodes are represented as '5'

Instructions to Run Demo
make
./tinyFSDemo
